# AWS Observability from Native Integrations to OpenTelemetry

Example code for the AWS Fundamentals article:

- __LINK_TO_ARTICLE__

We have two example projects:

- [AWS Native Integration](./aws-native-integration/) showing X-Ray and CloudWatch native integration with AWS Lambda runtime

- [AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry](./aws-distro-for-opentelemetry/) showing how to use the AWS distribution of OpenTelemetry configuration for AWS Lambda runtime

Our goal is to provide more examples of OpenTelemetry in AWS environments. Stay tuned!

We invite you to [join our Discord community](https://link.awsfundamentals.com/1HMSp4E) to discuss other solutions and demos. 

We are actively working to make that happen!
